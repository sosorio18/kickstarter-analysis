# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the outcomes of the different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. The main focus was on theatre campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges
In order to analyze the data some filters had to be done since the data inlcuded a lot of information. Since Louise wants to know how the different campaings fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, data had to be organized into two different ways. The first was outcomes based on lanch date and the second was outcomes based on goals. 
  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  In order to analyze the data, the data was separated into a new sheet to only include the outcome and the dates. As you can see in the tab labeled "Outcomes based on Launch Date" you are able to see how many were successful, failed, or canceled in each month of the year. This particular one is filtered by theatre campaign since that is Louise's major concern. To better see the relationship between outcomes and launch month a line chart was created. Below you could see the chart to better visualize the relationship for theatre outcomes based on launch date.

  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The next data that was analyzed was outcomes based on goals. This was done in order to see how the outcome fared in relation to the goal amount. In order to do this, the percentage of successful,failed, and canceled plays was calculated based on the funding goal amount. As you could see on the "Outcomes based on Goals" tab worksheet, the information used to gather this data was a goal coloumn was created based on goal amount, and number and percentafe of successful, failed, and canceled plays. To better visualize this information, another line chart was created to see the relationship between the goal amount ranges and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled play projects.

  ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  The dataset included alot of information and therefore had to be filtered. I didn't really encounter any difficulties but I assume if one doesn't play close attention to any filters done on the spreadsheet a mistake or miscalculation could be done that will affect the results. 
  ## Results
  * Two conclusions that can be drawn about Theatre outcomes based on launch are: successful campaigns had a spike that began in May and by the end of the year it started to decline. This means that the campaigns seems to be more successful starting around summer time than during the beginning of the year. You could also see that the number of canceled campiagns doesn't really have any correlation with the date. 
  * Based on the Outcomes Based on Goals data and chart, you can conlcude that as the number of goal amount increases, the number of successful campaigns decrease. You could see that campaigns that had a goal less than $1000 and between $1000-$4999 had the most success. Failed campaigns had higher goals. 
  * Some limitations of this dataset could be other factors that affect the number of successful or failed campaigns. For instance, there could be other factors that are not related to date or goals that are making the campaigns fail. 
  * Other graphs that could be created are one for the descriptive statistics, as well as total time the campaign lasted vs outcome.
